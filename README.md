# NasaApiApp

<h2> Overview </h2>
This Android application connects to the images.nasa.gov API, a REST API hosted by NASA that provides access to the NASA Image and Video Library. This library contains a vast collection of images, videos, and audio files related to NASAâ€™s missions and discoveries. The application allows users to search through this collection using a search bar and retrieve relevant data. Users can also select a search result to view more detailed information, including the title, date of creation, NASA ID, and description of the selected item.
